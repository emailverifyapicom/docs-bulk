Why Email Address Verification?
-------------------------------
Sending emails to non-existent addresses is never a good idea for many reasons including:

Damaging the reputation of your :term:`ESP` infrastructure (IP addresses)
	Many ESPs will have maximum hard bounce thresholds. Exceed these and your account could be closed.
	
Bad emails in a list negatively affects deliver-ability rates
	A :term:`Block List` can keep track of failed deliveries (e.g. bad email address) 
	at a particular domain. Too many failed deliveries can raise some flags thus raising the risk 
	of your email campaign being flagged as spam.
	
Processing hard bounces means wasted time
	An email sent to a bad or non-existent email address results in a bounce 
	message coming back. Someone or something (e.g. automated software) 
	is required to remove the bounces from a email list so as to avoid 
	sending to bad addresses next time.
	
.. tip:: 	Cleansing bad emails from a list using email verification technology 
			*before* embarking on an emailing campaign significantly 
			reduces the above challenges.
